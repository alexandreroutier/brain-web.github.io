### Propose a project
All you need to do to add your project to the BrainWeb community is to create a repository on GitHub and to add *BrainWeb* as a topic to the repo. It will then automatically be featured in the BrainWeb project pool on the website.  

Each project appears with the repo's title and description, and is linked to the GitHub repo. We will eventually add more info, like contributors, number of stars etc. If you do not have an image in your README, your project will be shown with a random genrated pattern image.
These patterns are lovely, but in case you'd prefer an image that shows what the project is about, here are our recommended guidelines:   

* (0) Create an image that shows in small format of dimensions 300px x 200px what you'd like to show --> save it as `yourproject_card.jpg` (small format is important so it doesn't slow BrainWeb website down as number of projects will grow  
* (1) add an image to your repo -->
* (2) click on the image to get its link (right click on image --> open in new tab --> copy browser url) --> 
* (3) paste this link into your readme file (either visible so like `![](https://github.com/brain-web/brain-web.github.io/raw/master/images/readme/brainweb_card.jpg)` or invisible as a comment (like this <!--(https://github.com/brain-web/brain-web.github.io/raw/master/images/readme/brainweb_card.jpg)--> (which we recommend as we create a small image for the card and don't show this one in the readme, but show a bigger image there :)  
Sidenote: The comment may not be visible depending on your Markdown renderer. You could open this ReadMe in `Raw` mode on GitHub to see the comment.
* (4) Your image will automatically show in the BrainWeb webpage   
Note: BrainWeb takes the first linked image it finds in your readme file. So you could potentially make the small version invisible at the top of your readme, and add a link to a larger image  for your readme itself.

See you in our next community call! :)
